                <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    This company will have fully-equiped camp trailers available for rental.
                    The aim is to provide wonderful family camping experiences without the 
                    hassle of owning and maintaining a family camp trailer. We will offer
                    a range of different services such as: delivery, fishing equipment, generator,
                    and potentially catered meals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website will describe the services and show the visitor what to expect in 
                    a visually appealing manner.
                </p>

                <h2>Color Schema</h2>
                <p>
                    I have used my colors throughout this document which should give
                    a good idea on how the selected colors will b used within the
                    website. I tried to use colors that remind me of the local colors 
                    that can be found in the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://coolors.co/000000-fffffc-beb7a4-ff7f11-ff3f00">Here</a> is a link to the color scheme that I chose to use.

                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>
                    I will only use one font throughout the site. Both for headers and for 
                    the body of each page as well. I will use the Rubik font with sans-serif
                    the fallback font. I like this font as I feel like it good looking font 
                    that appeared clean and modern with a hint of adventure.
